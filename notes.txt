Bugs:

TODOs:
  1. WinUI 3.0
  2. Custom extensions
  
Notes:
  1. When clicking the 'X' button in the search box, we should refilter the visible comics, instead of requiring
     the user to click on the search button again. (This is impossible)

Feature Requests:
  1. Add an expiration date to generated thumbnails, so they don't just pile up (Also, make sure thumbnails are
     actually generated when an item is added.)
  2. Add the ability to save filters into a list of bookmarks
  3. Add search/navigate to related tags/playlists in addition to authors
